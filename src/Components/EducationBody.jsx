              simply. Students "still need the foundation to be effective
              computer scientists and software engineers." In classrooms and
              bootcamps also, there is a push to strengthen understanding of
              algorithms, data structures, and system design. While AI can
              generate code, it still takes a human to know whether that code is
              correct, efficient, or even ethical.

              changes matter not just for students entering the field, but also
              for professionals looking to stay relevant. As one professor from
              Carnegie Mellon explains,{" "}

                "AI cannot be fully autonomous"

              that require judgment, creativity, and ethical reflection.
            </p>

            <p>
              This shift is pushing schools to prioritize skills that AI cannot
              easily replicate. Creativity, ethical reasoning, and communication
              are becoming just as important as coding ability, especially for
              future developers expected to collaborate with AI systems in team
              environments. For students, that means learning to approach
              problems from multiple angles, not just follow patterns. For
              educators, it means building courses that prepare students for
              jobs that do not exist yet. And for professionals, it means
              continuous learning will be essential as AI tools become standard
              in software teams across industries.

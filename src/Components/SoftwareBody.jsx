              Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing how software is
              developed, maintained, and tested. Across classrooms and industry,
              AI is no longer a futuristic concept. It is a practical tool that
              developers use daily. From automating repetitive tasks to
              detecting bugs before they reach production, AI tools are
              streamlining workflows and improving software quality. GitHub's
              CEO Thomas Dohmke highlighted the moment they discovered GPT-3's

              In large organizations, AI is also playing a growing role in

              in codebases". This kind of pattern recognition is helping
              software architects avoid redundant work and spot inefficiencies
              earlier in the process. For professionals managing complex
              systems, it means faster turnaround and fewer bugs reaching
              production. Whether working in testing, development, or systems
              design, today's engineers are learning how to integrate AI into
              their workflows without losing sight of their role. For computer
              science students and recent graduates, this means becoming fluent
              not just in programming languages, but in how to collaborate with
              intelligent tools. As AI continues to evolve, the most effective
              engineers will be those who can combine speed and scale with
              strategy and understanding.
